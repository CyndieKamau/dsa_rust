//Bubble Sort Algorithm
//Big O Notation of O(n^2)

//1. Start with the first element in the array
//2. If the first item is greater than the second, swap them
//3. Move to the next item (3rd item), repeat step 2 till end of array
//N.B. You'll notice automatically the largest item in array will be sorted "bubbled up" at the end of the array
//4. Repeat the same steps, excluding the last element as its already sorted
//5. Continue iterating while excluding last item, till the array is sorted
